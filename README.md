This repository of Jupyter notebook examples has been created for the hands-on tutorial session of the [1st PtyPy workshop](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Events/2023/Ptychography--PtyPy--Software-Workshop-2023.html), held on January 12th and 13th 2023 at the Diamond Light Source. The purpose of these tutorials is to provide a comprehensive collection of examples targeting a wide range of scientists and engineers interested in ptychography, from experimental users to algorithm and code developers.

The tutorials are hosted on [ptycho.github.io/tutorials](https://ptycho.github.io/tutorials) and are also available from this repository in the [notebooks](./notebooks) folder.
