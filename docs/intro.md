# Introduction

The purpose of these tutorials is to provide a comprehensive collection of examples targeting a wide range of scientists and engineers interested in ptychography, from experimental users to algorithm and code developers.

```{note}
Most of the content of this tutorial has been created in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and throughout this workshop, we are going to use JupyterLab to execute and interact with the content prepared for this workshop. The JupyterLab interface is very easy to use, but should you wish to learn more about the Jupyter project and the tools it provides, visit: [https://jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org).

## How to use a Jupyter Notebook

Before we get started with PtyPy, a few words about Jupyter Notebooks, which offer a convenient way to provide executable code (e.g. Python) alongside formatted text (using markdown). All notebooks used here are structured in the same way, with some informative content at the top and a full code example at the bottom, separated by a horizontal line:

```{figure} ./jupyter_notebook_1.PNG
:name: jupyterlab1
```

In order to execute the code cell (or any other cell), simply select the cell and type **SHIFT+ENTER** or **ALT+ENTER**

```{figure} ./jupyter_notebook_2.PNG
:name: jupyterlab2
```
